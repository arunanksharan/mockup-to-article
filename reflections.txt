Your response goes here!
1. What new skills have you learned?
I have learnt the basics of JavaScript. It has helped me understand the process of web development. I think I now have a strong foundation on which I can build upon to become a Front End Web Developer.
2. What has been easy?
Most of the stuff so far has been easy. It is mostly about learning the different elements and tags and then applying them within a given structure. It feels like learning a new language and the experience has been very enjoyable so far.
3. What has been difficult?
Nothing has been difficult yet.
4. How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Mozilla Deeveloper Netwrok and online documentations in addition to the Udacity lessons have helped me solve all the problems so far.
